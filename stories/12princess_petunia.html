	The Shoes That Were Danced to Pieces: Princess Petunia
	The King’s twelve daughters, each beautiful and more than the other. Each night they sleep together, their beds next to each other. When night falls and the world goes to sleep, the King bars their door. A means to protect them, or to keep control over them. 
The heavy treads of the King and his soldiers echo through the hallway as the bedtime of the princesses comes close. 
Bedtime: the princesses’ nightly routine were strict—the king always preached about being punctual. Dinner is served at 5, no earlier nor later. The girls were to be finished 30 minutes later, and then off to their leisure time. The King visits their room at 8, approximately an hour after the sun has FALLEN, where he expects his daughters to be in bed before he sees them to sleep. 
	“Petunia, hurry along.” The youngest sister who had been nose-deep into her book perks up at her sister’s warning. “You know Father wants you in bed by the time he’s here.” 
The older eleven sisters were all in their designated beds. At the foot of their bed was a trunk, bejeweled with their named flowers carved in. Petunia, due to her small frame, climbed the trunk as a stepstool to climb into bed.
As she begins to pull the covers over her, she turns to her eldest sister across from her. 
	“Will we be dancing again tonight?” she asks excitedly. Her sister, Rose, shushes her, glancing at the unopened door. 
	“Don’t let him hear you, silly child,” she chided. “Of course, we will be dancing.”
The door swings open, revealing the King with his knights behind him. With a wide smile, he scans the room, taking in the sights of his daughters who had sat up in their beds to greet him.
	“My girls, my beautiful girls. You’ve all had a long day today; I hope you get some rest.” He walks over to Petunia’s bed and gives her a loving kiss on the cheek. “Especially you, my little rascal.” 
My Little Rascal: Petunia had always been the King’s favorite. Perhaps it was because she was the youngest, or she resembled her late mother the most. Her sisters do not resent her for it, rather they also dote on her a lot. 
	“Goodnight, Father,” the girls said in unison. The King nodded in satisfaction before turning his back and walking out of the room. Petunia could hear the clicking of the lock as she and her sisters pulled the blankets over their heads. 
	The room stays silent for a few minutes. A feeling of excitement starts bubbling up in her stomach. 
	“Can we go yet?” she whispers, peeking out of her blanket.
	“Shush, girl,” Rose’s voice muffled under the blanket. “A few more minutes.” 
	Petunia sinks back into her blanket.
	After what seemed like forever, Rose finally got up. “Okay, I think we’re safe.”
	The three youngest perk up, jumping out of their beds, but before they are silenced by the older sisters before they could be loud. 
	Petunia’s heart pounds in her chest as she anticipates the long night ahead of her. 
	The girls pull on their dancing slippers and line up by Rose’s bed. 
	Two knocks on her headboard, and the bed sinks into the ground. A golden staircase opens and the girls make their way down, one by one, into the castle underground. 
		Castle underground: 
	12 golden princes greet them at the river with boats for each princess. Petunia lights up at the sight of her prince whom she’s named Charlie. Though faceless, she likes to imagine him smiling when he reaches his hand out to her. 
	“How are you today, Charlie?”
	The princes rowed the boats to the separate island where the grand pavilion lay. Petunia’s eyes light up when the shining castle comes into view. Her stage.
	As the music starts to play, she feels her body start to move on its own. Her sisters alongside her start their routine. Together with Charlie, she danced. And together they danced until the sun rose. 
	When time came for the girls to leave, Petunia felt a sadness in her heart. 
	“Will we get to dance with them again tomorrow?” she asks Rose, holding her hand as they walk back up the stairs to their bedroom. 
	“Of course,” she reassures. </p>

	<p>“But Rose,” Petunia keeps a wary eye on the sleeping soldier. “I have a bad feeling about him. He doesn’t seem like  the rest.”
	“Tsk, you worry too much, you snow goose,” she chides. “You are always afraid. There have been many princes who came for nothing. What makes you think he’s different? He won’t even wake!”
	But Petunia couldn’t shake the feeling. When the sisters are ready, they approach the soldier and after no reaction, Rose knocks on her bed, and they descend. Petunia glances back one more time at the sleeping figure by the door follows suit.
