<p>Hansel & Gretel: Gretel
	“Brother.” The fire crackles in the corner of the small room. Hansel, sitting at the opposite edge of the bed, hums in response. “Brother, do you think we will have food tomorrow?”
Fire: a small fireplace Father had built us when winter struck. He felt bad we didn’t have food every day and wanted us to stay warm at least. 
Hansel: Though he has a strong passion for baking, Brother helps Father cut wood many days. “Father works hard,” he says, “I want to help if I can. And maybe one day, I can make you a cake again.”
	“Of course,” he puts down the paper he was doodling on and comes to sit next to me. “Father and Mother will take care of us.” 
	“Do you think there’s any bread left? I’m hungry.” 
I’m Hungry: a famine had struck the land. Father gave us as much as he could, but somedays we wouldn’t even have bread.
	“Let’s go ask.”
	Hansel holds my hand while we walk quietly to the kitchen. The door was slightly ajar, the faint, flickering candle peeking through. As we walked closer, I could hear Mother and Father talking.
