"Asleep"

- an adaptation of "Sleeping Beauty" in the form of interactive narration using Twine, created for my Independent Study Capstone for University of Pittsburgh's Digital Narrative & Interactive Design program.

Retold through the perspective of the Prince, players can explore the world of "Sleeping Beauty" by clicking through hyperlinks. Through the decisions made, players have three achievable endings: the Brute, the Empath, and the Knowledgeable.
